#### Accelerator and Beam Conditions Critical for EIC Simulations
<hr/>
A note summarizes how measurements at the Electron-Ion Collider will
be influenced by accelerator and beam effects, including the:

* Beam crossing angle.
* Crabbing rotation.
* Beam energy spread.
* Angular beam divergence.
* Beam vertex spread.

The accelerator and beam effects may have profound consequences on the
measurement capabilities of the EIC, as well as the design and layout
of the detectors. The effects studied in the note should be included
in physics and detector simulations for the EIC. The supplementary
material gives example implementations on the generator level as well
as for a generator-agnostic approach on how to integrate these effects
in physics and detector simulations for the EIC.

It also includes a movie illustrating the electron and proton bunch
movement during their interaction. The visualization is for an
electron-proton collision at 18x275 GeV and based on the transport
model described in the note.
