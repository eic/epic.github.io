- name:               inclusive
  description:        'Inclusive'
  mission_statement:  'The inclusive physics working group evaluates the ability of the ePIC detector to observe inclusive processes. As this largely relies on detecting the scattered beam electron, the inclusive PWG is contributing significantly to the development of electron identification and reconstruction algorithms. Inclusive kinematics can also be reconstructed using information from the hadronic final state, and therefore the inclusive PWG is also contributing to hadronic reconstruction algorithms. Evaluating the resolutions of multiple reconstruction methods across the ePIC acceptance will allow maximal exploitation of ePICs capabilities. Last but not least, the inclusive PWG is benchmarking ePIC performance by extracting key inclusive physics observables, namely reduced cross sections (NC and CC) and double-spin asymmetries.'

  description:        'Semi-Inclusive'
  mission_statement:  'The semi-inclusive working group evaluates the performance of the ePIC detector for the future measurements of semi-inclusive processes. For this, it needs to study the reconstruction of the scattered lepton and the typical DIS variables as well as the reconstruction of the produced hadrons, including the quality of their identification.'

  mission_statement:  'The BSM and EW group looks at physics topics that are not usually associated with the EIC such as Charged Lepton Flavor Violation and Dark Photons. The impressive ePIC detector will allow for physics reach that is complementary to other searches of beyond the standard model physics at the LHC or other low energy facilities around the world. The group explores ways to improve detector sensitivities to such searches through particle detection and simulations. New ideas and exploratory investigations are welcome and supported within the group.'
