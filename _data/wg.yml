  mission_statement:  'The responsibilities of the Exclusive, Diffraction, and Tagging working group are to evaluate the performance of the ePIC detector as it relates to exclusive, diffractive, or tagging processes. We are charged with the development of a set of performance and physics benchmarks.'

  description:        'Semi-Inclusive'
  mission_statement:  'The semi-inclusive working group evaluates the performance of the ePIC detector for the future measurements of semi-inclusive processes. For this, it needs to study the reconstruction of the scattered lepton and the typical DIS variables as well as the reconstruction of the produced hadrons, including the quality of their identification.'

  mission_statement:  'The responsibilities of the Jets and Heavy Flavor working group are to evaluate the performance of the ePIC detector as it relates to jet and heavy flavor observables utilizing a set of performance and physics benchmarks. We also work on developing the analysis techniques and software tools needed to implement the benchmarks used in detector evaluation.'

  description:        'BSM and EW'
  mission_statement:  'The BSM and EW group looks at physics topics that are not usually associated with the EIC such as Charged Lepton Flavor Violation and Dark Photons. The impressive ePIC detector will allow for physics reach that is complementary to other searches of beyond the standard model physics at the LHC or other low energy facilities around the world. The group explores ways to improve detector sensitivities to such searches through particle detection and simulations. New ideas and exploratory investigations are welcome and supported within the group.'
