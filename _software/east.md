(eA Simulation Toolkit) is led by Makoto Asai (SLAC) and builds on the work done in existing detector simulations for the EIC. To ease leveraging new and rapidly evolving computing technologies, we are implementing a common and integrated approach for fast and full detector simulations in Geant4 with a plug and play modular approach. Members of the EICUG Software Group are actively involved in this project.
