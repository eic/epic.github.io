The event generator [DJANGOH](http://www.desy.de/~hspiesb/mcp.html) simulates deep inelastic lepton-proton scattering for both NC and CC events including both QED and QCD radiative effects.

DJANGOH contains the Monte Carlo program HERACLES and an interface of HERACLES to LEPTO. The use of HERACLES allows to take into account the complete one-loop electroweak radiative corrections and radiative scattering.
The LUND string fragmentation as implemented in the event simulation program [JETSET](http://home.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html) is used to obtain the complete hadronic final state. At low hadronic mass, [SOPHIA](http://ebl.stanford.edu/) is used instead of LEPTO.
DJANGOH comprises the programs (formerly kept separately) DJANGO6 and HERACLES. The interface is to version 6.5.1 of [LEPTO](http://www.isv.uu.se/thep/lepto/).

For the EIC, DJANGOH was upgraded to use nuclear PDFs as available in [LHAPDF](https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/).
From version 4.6.10 on, DJANGOH simulates also longitudinal polarised deep inelastic lepton-proton scattering for both NC and CC events including both QED and QCD radiative effects.
