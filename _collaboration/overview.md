#### Collaboration Organization

**The ePIC Collaboration Charter - version 1.0, as passed by the ePIC IB on 12/14/2022:** [EPIC_Charter-v1.0.pdf](https://zenodo.org/records/11584258)

By charter, the ePIC Collaboration is organized around a *Collaboration Council*, with proportional representation for the institutions that make up the ePIC Collabiration.  An elected *Collaboration Council Chair* and *Vice Chair* organize meetings of the Council, and oversee the standing committees defined in the charter. A *Spokesperson* is elected every two years, and the *Spokesperson's Office* manages the scientific activity of the collaboration. A management plan is submitted by the *Spokesperson's Office* to the *Collaboration Council*. Top-level postitions within the management plan (like *Coordinators* or *Working Group Conveners*) also require endorsement by the Council.

The management structure of the ePIC Collaboration is built around three *Coordination Offices* - *Technical Coordination*, *Software and Computing* and *Analysis*. The *Coordination Offices* each manage a set of *Working Groups (WGs)*.

The Detector effort is also managed by the *Technical Coordination Office*, but is organized into a set of *Detector Subsystem Collaborations (DSCs)*. The DSC's appoint their own leadership from the collaborators committed to each detector effort in the form of *Detector Subsystem Leaders (DSLs)* and *Detector Subsystem Technical Coordinators (DSTCs)*.
