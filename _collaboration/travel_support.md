This page provides information on travel support opportunities available to members of the ePIC collaboration.

#### Currently Available Travel Support Programs
* **BNL Travel Support**:  Brookhaven National Laboratory offers travel support for ePIC-related trips to (i) BNL for meetings, reviews, and detector-related work, as well as (ii) travel to ePIC collaboration meetings. To request travel support from BNL, please download the [travel support request form](https://). Complete the form and obtain a support letter from your supervisor or group leader which should also explain why financial support is needed. Submit both documents to Rachel Inguanta at irachel@bnl.gov. BNL will review your request and notify you in a timely manner regarding the availability and level of support, which may vary as outlined in the form. Please note that travel support is not available for general conferences and workshops unless they are entirely ePIC-related.
