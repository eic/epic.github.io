***The members of ePIC collaboration who are either an undergraduate or masters student, a PhD candidate or researchers with not more than five years of post PhD experience (not counting career interruptions) are the early-career members.***

*It is important to subscribe the [Mattermost Channel](https://chat.epic-eic.org/main/channels/early-career) and [mailing list](https://lists.bnl.gov/mailman/listinfo/eic-projdet-earlycareer-l) to receive the updates and news of the collaboration regulary. Only members who are enlisted in the mailing list will have voting rights for the early career representative's elections.*
