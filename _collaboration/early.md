**The members of ePIC collaboration who are either an undergraduate or masters student, a PhD candidate or researchers with not more than five years of post PhD experience (not counting career interruptions) are the early-career members.**

It is important to subscribe the [Mattermost Channel](https://chat.epic-eic.org/main/channels/early-career){:target="_blank"} and [mailing list](https://lists.bnl.gov/mailman/listinfo/eic-projdet-earlycareer-l){:target="_blank"} to receive the updates and news of the collaboration regulary. Only members who are enlisted in the mailing list will have voting rights for the early career representative's elections.

Be vocal about the challenges early career members are facing or may face in the future. Your thoughts will be presented to the relevant body of the collaboration. Please share your [feedback](https://forms.gle/GSus6iVM8Ldcem9AA){:target="_blank"}.

#### Representation of Early Career

* **Collaboration Council**

	Three early career members are elected for a two-year term. At least one of the elected members must be a graduate student (Master's or PhD candidate). They will serve as a bridge between the members and the council, voting in the council to represent the decisions of the members on relevant topics.

#### EIC Early Career Workshop

**A dedicated program for early career members is organized in conjunction with the summer EIC User Group and/or the ePIC collaboration meeting.**

It is an exciting platform organised by Jefferson Lab, Brookhaven Lab and host institute to present and celebrate the research of rising talents. The event is designed to be dynamic, featuring engagin  seminars by renowned experts in the field, followed with 10-15 minutes carefully selected talks from early career researchers. These talks provide an excellen  opportunity for young researchers to share their work, gain valuable feedback, and foster collaborations. To make the experience even more rewarding, a dedicated prize is awarded to the most outstanding presentations. The day concludes with a relaxed hangout during dinner, offering the perfect setting to network, share ideas, and unwind with peers.
