#### State of Software Survey {#survey}

The Software Working Group collected in February 2021 information on
the community's specific software tools and practices during the
Yellow Report Initiative. This software census will be essential to
better understand and quantify software usage throughout the EIC
community.

{% include documents/doc.md name='SWG-Survey-202102.pdf' %}

We will organize next the focus-group discussions that will result in
user stories. These user stories will provide input to software
developers as to which users they are writing software for.

The Software Working Group will repeat the survey at the end of 2021
to compare results as we continue to design and build the Electron-Ion
Collider. In the meanwhile, please do not hesitate to reach out with
your comments or suggestions via
