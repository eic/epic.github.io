The Statement of Principles represent guiding principles for EIC Software. They have been endorsed by the international EIC community. The [endorsers](#endorsers) are listed below. The Statement of Principles are also available as [PDF version](https://www.dropbox.com/s/l21sbvmx6fonsk4/EIC%20Software%20-%20Statement%20of%20Software%20Principles.pdf?dl=0).

## Statement of Principles 
**1. We aim to develop a diverse workforce, while also cultivating an environment of equity and inclusivity as well as a culture of belonging.**

**2. We will have an unprecedented compute-detector integration:**
- We will have a common software stack for online and offline software, including the processing of streamed data and its time-ordered structure. 
- We aim for autonomous alignment and calibration.
- We aim for a rapid, near-real-time turnaround of the raw data to online and offline productions.  

**3. We will leverage heterogeneous computing:**
- We will enable distributed workflows on the computing resources of the worldwide EIC community, leveraging not only HTC but also HPC systems. 
- EIC software should be able to run on as many systems as possible, while supporting specific system characteristics, e.g., accelerators such as GPUs, where beneficial. 
- We will have a modular software design with structures robust against changes in the computing environment so that changes in underlying code can be handled without an entire overhaul of the structure. 

**4. We will aim for user-centered design:**

- We will enable scientists of all levels worldwide to actively participate in the science program of the EIC, keeping the barriers low for smaller teams.
- EIC software will run on the systems used by the community, easily. 
- We aim for a modular development paradigm for algorithms and tools without the need for users to interface with the entire software environment.

**5. Our data formats are open, simple and self-descriptive:**
- We will favor simple flat data structures and formats to encourage collaboration with computer, data, and other scientists outside of NP and HEP. 
- We aim for access to the EIC data to be simple and straightforward. 

**6. We will have reproducible software:**
- Data and analysis preservation will be an integral part of EIC software and the workflows of the community. 
- We aim for fully reproducible, re-usable, and re-interpretable analyses that are based on reusable software and are amenable to adjustments and new interpretations. 

**7. We will embrace our community:**
- EIC software will be open source with attribution to its contributors. 
- We will use publicly available productivity tools. 
- EIC software will be accessible by the whole community. 
- We will ensure that mission critical software components are not dependent on the expertise of a single developer, but managed and maintained by a core group. 
- We will not reinvent the wheel but rather aim to build on and extend existing efforts in the wider scientific community. 
- We aim for a modular development paradigm for algorithms and tools without the need for users to interface with the entire software environment.
- We will support the community with active training and support sessions where experienced software developers and users interact with new users.  
- We will support the careers of scientists who dedicate their time and effort towards software development. 

**8. We will provide a production-ready software stack throughout the development:**
- We will not separate software development from software use and support. 
- We are committed to providing a software stack for EIC science that continuously evolves and can be used to achieve all EIC milestones. 
- We will deploy metrics to evaluate and improve the quality of our software. 
- We aim to continuously evaluate, adapt/develop, validate, and integrate new software, workflow, and computing practices.
