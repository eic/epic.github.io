The ePIC Collaboration is leveraging [Zenodo digital repository](https://zenodo.org/){:target="_blank"}
for its document management capability. Our materials are managed as the
["ePIC Community on Zenodo"](https://zenodo.org/communities/epic/){:target="_blank"}.

### What is Zenodo?

Zenodo is an open-source data repository designed for scientific
disciplines. ePIC is using a public implementation called Zenodo.org
which is supported by CERN, OpenAire and the European Union. For more
information, consult the Zenodo.org [<span
class="underline">FAQ</span>](https://help.zenodo.org/faq/).

### How To Upload A Document to Zenodo

Start by navigating to [<span
class="underline">Zenodo.org</span>](http://zenodo.org) and log in or
create an account. Either process is simple and straightforward. If you
are creating a new account, consider using either a ORCID or GitHub sign
in to simplify the process. In particular, ORCID is a unique, persistent
identifier that can be used across multiple platforms. For more
information, visit [<span
class="underline">orcid.org</span>](https://info.orcid.org/what-is-orcid/).

Once you are logged in, go to your Dashboard, as shown on the right
below:

<img src="/assets/images/zenodo/ZenodoDashboardLink.png" style="width:4.17161in;height:0.47064in" />

In your Dashboard in the upper right-hand corner you will see a button
that will start the process of uploading a new document.

<img src="/assets/images/zenodo/NewUpload.png" style="width:1.7in;height:0.71667in" />

<img src="/assets/images/zenodo/NewUploadForm.png" style="width:6.49167in;height:4.54167in" />

From this form you can upload your file and answer some basic questions
to allow the submission to be categorized. Don‚Äôt panic! There‚Äôs a lot of
information requested in this form, but only some is required.

The first thing that you will want to do is to associate this upload
with the ePIC Community. Hit the ‚ÄúSelect a Community‚Äù button at the top
of the page, and type in ‚ÄúePIC‚Äù ‚Äì the ePIC Experiment will be at the top
of the list of communities for you to select.

You can now fill in the metadata for your upload. At a minimum, your
upload should include the following information:

-   A DOI (Digital Object Identifier). If you already have one you can enter it on the form, if you don‚Äôt select ‚ÄúNo‚Äù and a button will appear that will allow you to generate one for your document.

-   Select a descriptive title and publication date. If this is a conference presentation, it is helpful if you use the date you made the presentation. Otherwise, you can just enter today‚Äôs date.

-   You will need to add information about the creator of this document. Typically this is you, but you can add multiple creators if that is appropriate. If you have an ORCID ID, it‚Äôs best to enter this in the form to add a creator as that uniquely identifies you.

-   Add a meaningful description.

-   The default license for the document (Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International) is usually fine. If you want a specific license, you can select one here.

This is all the required information by Zenodo, but to make the document
easy to find for your fellow collaborators you should add one or more
keywords. All ePIC documents should include at a minimum the ‚Äúepic-eic‚Äù
keyword. Additional keywords for ePIC documents are maintained on the
[<span class="underline">ePIC
website</span>](https://www.epic-eic.org/documents/keywords.html). If
you are unsure of the keywords, don‚Äôt worry, the curator will check the
keywords and update them if necessary.

You can also fill in additional information on funding, publisher,
related works, and alternate identifiers. You can also include
references to software repositories, but none of these are necessary.

The last thing you have to do is decide if your document will be
‚ÄúPublic‚Äù or ‚ÄúRestricted‚Äù. A ‚ÄúPublic‚Äù document is available to the world.
This might be appropriate for a conference presentation or proceedings.
A ‚ÄúRestricted‚Äù document is only available to members of the ePIC
community.

The last step is to submit your document for review. Click the ‚ÄúSubmit
for Review‚Äù button in the upper right hand corner. Your document will be
queued for approval by a DSC Leader, WG Convener or Conference Committee
Chair or Vice-Chair. There is no automatic notification, so it would be
a good idea to email the relevant person or persons and let them know a
document is available for approval.

If there are any problems with the information Zenodo.org will let you
know and you can correct it and resubmit.

### How To Approve A Document Submission to Zenodo

Under **My Dashboard -&gt; Requests** (or **My Dashboard -&gt;
Communities -&gt; ePIC -&gt; Requests**) click on the request that you
want to review. You can also get there from the link sent in the
notification email titled ‚Äúüì• New record submission to your community
'ePIC'‚Äù.

<img src="/assets/images/zenodo/NewSubmission.png" style="width:6.5in;height:1.875in" />

After clicking on the request title, go to the **Record** tab**.**
Review the metadata, like, e.g., conference name, description, etc. Most
importantly, check if the proper keyword has been added to the entry
(list of keywords: [<span
class="underline">https://www.epic-eic.org/documents/keywords.html</span>](https://www.epic-eic.org/documents/keywords.html)).

If you see that some metadata requires modification you can either fix
it yourself by clicking **Edit**, or in the **Conversation** tab request
changes from the person submitting the record. In particular, check the
keywords - Is the required keyword ‚Äúepic-eic‚Äù included? Are there other
keywords specific to the Working Group or DSC that should be added?

If all issues has been resolved click **Accept and publish**
