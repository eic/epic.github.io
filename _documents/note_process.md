This page summarizes the procedure for submitting an analysis or technical note to the ePIC document repository. This is intended to be a simple, lightweight procedure that ensure that everyone relevant is informed when a new analysis or technical note is created.

* **Step 1**: Collaborator contacts the Analysis/Technical/Software and Computing Coordination Office with title to receive note number
  * Analysis/Technical/Software and Computing Coordination Offices maintain note numbers and list of notes
* **Step 2**: DSC/WG leadership signs off on note
  * Work with DSC/WG leadership to identify the most appropriate DSC/WG
  * Review should focus on accuracy of the material in the note
  * DSC/WG leadership sends an email to the Analysis/Technical/Software and Computing Coordinators to confirm
* **Step 3**: Collaborator submits to Zenodo
  * Use keywords “ana_note” and “tech_note”, along with any other keywords that will make it easy to find the note efficiently. A list of official keywords is available [here.](/documents/keywords)
* **Step 4**: Analysis/Technical/Software and Computing Coordinators approve publishing to ePIC
  * Analysis and Technical notes will be made available to ePIC Community members
