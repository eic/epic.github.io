##### Proposed keywords

_The keywords in this section have not yet been approved for official use in ePIC. Please consider sending comments and/or suggestions to John Lajoie and Silvia Dalla Torre._

An attempt was made to adhere to conventions that reduce chances of misspelling or ambiguity, and allow
reliable cross-reference with other information systems where necessary. For example, it is best to have
all keywords in lowercase, and reduce composite keywords (e.g. _A-B_) to an absolute minimum.
