#### Conferences

* Please note that conference keywords (tags) are presented on a dedicated [conference page](/documents/conferences.html) with links to the conferences' websites.
* Some of the keywords are posted here before the correponding materials are uploaded to Zenodo, which means not every query will return results.

##### Proposed misc keywords

_The keywords in this section have not yet been approved for official use in ePIC. Please consider sending comments and/or suggestions to John Lajoie and Silvia Dalla Torre._

An attempt was made to adhere to conventions that reduce chances of misspelling or ambiguity, and allow
reliable cross-reference with other information systems where necessary.<br/> For example, it is best to have
all keywords in lowercase, and avoid composite keywords (e.g. _A-B_).
