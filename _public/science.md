### Exploring the Quark-Gluon Structure of Matter

The search for understanding and imaging the structure of ordinary matter, which forms the visible world around us, has been a focal point of scientific inquiry in recent decades. Nucleons—protons and neutrons, the building blocks of atomic nuclei—are composed of fractionally charged valence quarks and dynamically produced quark-antiquark pairs, all bound together by gluons, the carriers of the strong force. Modern nuclear physics seeks to understand the structure of protons and neutrons through quark and gluon interactions, as described by the theory of the strong force - quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and how interactions between protons and neutrons in nuclei emerge from these dynamics.

Despite significant progress, many fundamental questions about the nature of ordinary matter remain unanswered. One of the most profound mysteries is how quarks and gluons, which carry a type of charge related to the strong interaction known as "color," combine to form colorless protons and neutrons, how the properties of nucleons and nuclei emerge from the dynamics of quarks and gluons, and how the residual color forces hold these nucleons together to form atomic nuclei. The ePIC Detector at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is designed to tackle these challenges, providing new insights and deepening our understanding of the fundamental nature of matter.

#### Harnessing Electron Scattering

The EIC will employ electron scattering on protons and ions to investigate their internal structures with unprecedented precision of electromagnetic interactions. The ePIC Detector will analyze particles from thousands of collisions per second, collecting crucial data to uncover subtle effects and gain insights into the intricacies of matter. By studying these energetic collisions of electrons with protons and heavier nuclei, ePIC will enable the exploration of uncharted territories in matter dominated by gluons and transient quark-antiquark pairs known as the quark sea.

The structure of matter will be studied through a class of deep inelastic scattering processes, where the probed nucleon breaks apart, or through exclusive processes where it remains intact. In these processes, an incoming electron emits a high-energy virtual photon that interacts with the nucleon, thereby probing its internal structure. The fraction of the nucleon's momentum carried by the struck quark, denoted as x, and the resolution power at which the nucleon is probbed, Q², can be accessed via the measurement of the scattered electron.

### Imaging of Nucleons

The EIC and its ePIC Detector will address fundamental questions about nucleons, including how their properties like mass and spin emerge from their partonic structure, and how sea quarks and gluons, along with their spins, are distributed in space and momentum within the nucleon. Through advanced electron scattering techniques, this research will illuminate the complex quark-gluon interactions that form the foundation of visible matter.

#### Unraveling the Mystery of Proton Spin

Understanding the origin of the proton's spin is a fundamental challenge in nuclear physics. While protons are composed of three quarks, the spins of these quarks account for only about 30% of the proton's spin. The remaining spin is believed to arise from gluon spins, sea quarks, and the orbital motion of quarks and gluons. The ePIC Detector at EIC is designed to probe these contributions in unprecedented detail. By colliding longitudinally polarized electrons with nucleons and analyzing both inclusive and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering events, we will measure the spin contributions from gluons and various quark flavors. In inclusive deep inelastic scattering, only the scattered electron is detected, while in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering, an additional hadron created in the collisions is also detected and identified. This comprehensive approach will allow researchers to precisely quantify the factors contributing to the proton's spin, offering new insights into one of the most profound puzzles of nuclear physics.

#### How Does the Mass of the Nucleon Arise?

While the Higgs mechanism explains the mass of the electron, it only contributes minimally to the mass of nucleons—protons and neutrons—which constitute the majority of visible mass in the universe. Nucleons derive their mass primarily from gluons, sea quarks, and the kinetic energy of valence quarks. Gluons, despite lacking electric charge, significantly influence nucleon mass through the energy stored in their fields, which remains challenging to measure directly. The Electron-Ion Collider, equipped with the ePIC Detector, will be instrumental in advancing our understanding of these fundamental aspects. Utilizing parton tomography, the EIC will map the distribution of gluons within the proton with unprecedented precision in both spatial and momentum domains. Traditional Deep Inelastic Scattering measures longitudinal momentum fractions of probed constituents of the nucleons, whereas tomography adds insights into transverse distance and transverse momentum, uncovering critical details about the 3D distributions of quarks and gluons. By generating tomographic images across various longitudinal momentum fractions, from valence quarks to deeper states, the EIC will unveil crucial details about gluon spatial configurations. The EIC's broad kinematic range and high luminosity, facilitated by the ePIC Detector, will enable comprehensive studies of gluonic energy density and pressure within the proton, refining our understanding of nucleon mass origins and theoretical models of gluon behavior

#### 3D Imaging of Nucleons

The Electron-Ion Collider, enhanced by the ePIC Detector, will enable precise 3D imaging of gluons and sea quarks in both momentum and position spaces within nucleons. Momentum imaging will primarily utilize the semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering process, where the probed nucleon is destroyed in the scattering event, and at least one outgoing hadron is detected. Access to imaging in position space will be facilitated by exclusive processes, where the probed proton remains intact and either a real photon or a bound quark-antiquark state (meson) is produced.

##### Imaging in momentum space

With semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering, the ePIC detector will probe both the large momentum transfer from the electron beam for high spatial resolution and the transverse momentum of produced hadrons. This approach enables detailed investigations into the confined motion of partons within nucleons, essential for understanding their three-dimensional dynamics encoded in Transverse Momentum Distributions (TMDs). TMDs provide critical insights into correlations between parton motion, spin, and orbital contributions in polarized protons, shedding light on the complex interplay of sea quarks and gluons at different momentum scales. These correlations may arise from spin-orbit coupling among the partons, a phenomenon currently underexplored. With its capabilities in polarized beam collisions, the ePIC detector promises unprecedented advancements in unraveling the intricacies of 3D nucleon structure that remain inaccessible to current facilities.

##### Imaging in position space

With its broad range of collision energies and high luminosity, the EIC equipped with the nearly hermetic ePIC detector will achieve unprecedented precision in imaging the proton across varying transverse distances. The accessible kinematic range of the EIC extends from regions dominated by sea quarks and gluons to those where valence quarks become prominent, establishing connections with experiments sensitive to the valence region.
 Tomographic images derived from the measuremets of mentioned earlier exclusive processes are encapsulated within Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs). GPDs provide intricate insights into spin-orbit correlations and the angular momentum of partons, including both their spin and orbital motion. The comprehensive kinematic coverage offered by the EIC and ePIC detector will be instrumental in discerning contributions of quark and gluon angular momentum to the proton's overall spin.


### Exploring Nuclei as QCD Laboratories

The nucleus serves as a unique environment in QCD, characterized by its complex structure of bound nucleons. Understanding the intricate process of nuclear formation within Quantum Chromodynamics stands as a fundamental goal of nuclear physics. The Electron-Ion Collider with the ePIC Detector is poised as a groundbreaking experimental facility capable of probing various nuclei through inclusive and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and exclusive measurements. It offers unprecedented insights into the three-dimensional structure of sea quarks and gluons within swiftly moving nuclei. Moreover, the nucleus serves as an exceptional QCD laboratory, enabling the exploration of collective phenomena in gluonic matter at high gluon densities and facilitating studies on the dynamics of fast-moving color charges within a nuclear medium.
