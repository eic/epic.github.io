### Exploring the Quark-Gluon Structure of Matter

The search for understanding and imaging the structure of ordinary matter, which forms the visible world around us, has been a focal point of scientific inquiry in recent decades. Nucleons—protons and neutrons, the building blocks of atomic nuclei—are composed of fractionally charged valence quarks and dynamically produced quark-antiquark pairs, all bound together by gluons, the carriers of the strong force. Modern nuclear physics seeks to understand the structure of protons and neutrons through quark and gluon interactions, as described by the theory of the strong force - quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and how interactions between protons and neutrons in nuclei emerge from these dynamics.

Despite significant progress, many fundamental questions about the nature of ordinary matter remain unanswered. One of the most profound mysteries is how quarks and gluons, which carry a type of charge related to the strong interaction known as "color," combine to form colorless protons and neutrons, how the properties of nucleons and nuclei emerge from the dynamics of quarks and gluons, and how the residual color forces hold these nucleons together to form atomic nuclei. The ePIC Detector at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is designed to tackle these challenges, providing new insights and deepening our understanding of the fundamental nature of matter.

#### Harnessing Electron Scattering

The EIC will employ electron scattering on protons and ions to investigate their internal structures with unprecedented precision in electromagnetic interactions. The ePIC Detector will analyze particles from thousands of collisions per second, collecting crucial data to uncover subtle effects and gain insights into the intricacies of matter. By studying these energetic collisions of electrons with protons and heavier nuclei, ePIC will enable the exploration of uncharted territories in matter dominated by gluons and transient quark-antiquark pairs known as the quark sea, originating from gluons.

### Imaging of Nucleons

The EIC and its ePIC Detector will address fundamental questions about nucleons, including how their properties like mass and spin emerge from their partonic structure, and how sea quarks and gluons, along with their spins, are distributed in space and momentum within the nucleon. Through advanced electron scattering techniques, this research will illuminate the complex quark-gluon interactions that form the foundation of visible matter.

#### Unraveling the Mystery of Proton Spin

Understanding the origin of the proton's spin is a fundamental challenge in nuclear physics. While protons are composed of three quarks, the spins of these quarks account for only about 30% of the proton's spin. The remaining spin is believed to arise from gluon spins, sea quarks, and the orbital motion of quarks and gluons. The ePIC Detector at EIC is designed to probe these contributions in unprecedented detail. By colliding longitudinally polarized electrons with nucleons and analyzing both inclusive and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering events, we will measure the spin contributions from gluons and various quark flavors. In inclusive deep inelastic scattering, only the scattered electron is detected, while in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering, an additional hadron created in the collisions is also detected and identified. This comprehensive approach will allow researchers to precisely quantify the factors contributing to the proton's spin, offering new insights into one of the most profound puzzles of nuclear physics.
