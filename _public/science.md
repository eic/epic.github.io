### Exploring the Quark-Gluon Structure of Matter
---

The search for understanding and imaging the structure of ordinary matter, which forms the visible world around us, has been a focal point of scientific inquiry in recent decades. Nucleons—protons and neutrons, the building blocks of atomic nuclei—are composed of fractionally charged valence quarks and dynamically produced quark-antiquark pairs, all bound together by gluons, the carriers of the strong force. Modern nuclear physics seeks to understand the structure of protons and neutrons through quark and gluon interactions, as described by the theory of the strong force - quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and how interactions between protons and neutrons in nuclei emerge from these dynamics.

Despite significant progress, many fundamental questions about the nature of ordinary matter remain unanswered. One of the most profound mysteries is how quarks and gluons, which carry a type of charge related to the strong interaction known as "color," combine to form colorless protons and neutrons, how the properties of nucleons and nuclei emerge from the dynamics of quarks and gluons, and how the residual color forces hold these nucleons together to form atomic nuclei. The ePIC Detector at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is designed to tackle these challenges, providing new insights and deepening our understanding of the fundamental nature of matter.
