##### Central Detector

The **Central Detector** is very compact and it has an acceptance of 2o-178o, limited by the beam pipes.
It includes a **[tracking system](#tracking_detectors)**, an extended system for
**[particle identification](#pid-detectors)**, a set of
**[electromagnetic calorimeters](#electromagnetic-calorimeter-detectors)**, the
**[superconducting solenoid](#superconducting-solenoid)** providing the electrical field for particle momentum analysis and the
**[hadron calorimeters](#hadron-calorimeter-detectors)** forming the most external layer of the detector.

The detector hermeticity is to a large extent restore equipping the angular
regions not covered by the central detector by the Far Detectors
situated along the outgoing beam lines. The **Far Detectors** along the
outgoing ion beam line detect proton with different magnetic rigidity,
soft photons and neutron. Along the outgoing electron beam line, the low Q2
tagger station complete the Q2 acceptance of the Central Detector, while the
luminosity station makes possible the, measurement and monitoring of the luminosity
provided by the collider.
