##### The EPIC Detector Coordinate System definition

For EIC the hadron beam is going counter clockwise and the lepton beam clockwise.
The hadron beam defines the positive z axis and x points to the ring inside as would be correct for a right handed coordinate system.
* y-axis pointing to the sky
* x-axis pointing to the ring inside
* z-axis pointing along the ring in the direction of the hadron beam
* The origin (0,0,0) of this coordinate system is at EIC IP-6.
* The IP is in the EIC detector coordinate system at x=0, y=0, and z=0
* The RHIC IP is in the EIC detector coordinate system at x= -80.9883cm, y=0, z= +13.77mm
