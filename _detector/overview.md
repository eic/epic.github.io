#### Expression of Interest for Software {#eoi}

The Software Working Group is coordinating an [Expression of
Interest](https://www.bnl.gov/eic/EOI.php) for Software. In the
Expression of Interest, we would like to leverage everyoneâ€™s
experience to define requirements for EIC Software and identify common
software projects based on these requirements.

Based on the discussion of our [first
meeting](https://indico.bnl.gov/event/9170/), we have prepared an
outline. The outline includes common project areas that the community
has identified thus far. All are welcome to declare their interest,
extend the list of projects, and contribute to the
writeup. Contributions can be made directly to the [outline
document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nqs2rTH4K8oM9KTpkWfyxOQReRXWnTNfmyuQu-VHbSo/edit?usp=sharing)
as it evolves into a full draft, under the editorship of the SWG
conveners.

The Expression of Interest will cover all components of EIC Software:
Simulation, reconstruction, physics analyses, streaming readout,
online monitoring, etc., and will include emerging technologies such
as AI and possibly Quantum Computing.
