#### ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

###### Working with simulation files on S3:

* [How can we access simulation files on S3 storage?](https://doc.athena-eic.org/en/latest/howto/s3_file_storage.html)
* How can we work with trees in S3 storage without downloading files?
* How can we locate specific files in S3 and better understand their directory structure?
* How can we determine the properties of simulated files, such as parameters, particles, and energies?

##### Tracking

* How can we effectively use the information stored in EICRecon rootfile outputs, such as matching reconstructed particles to their MC particles?

##### Far Forward/Far Backward detectors

* How can we apply beam effects, including adjusting the ion beam when using a particle gun?
* How do we check and change beam magnet settings for both simulation and reconstruction?


##### Inclusive physics

* What are the commands for browsing files on S3 and copying them to local directories?
* How can we load files into ROOT directly from S3?
* What is the best practice for analyzing EICrecon output, especially regarding hadron PID likelihoods?


##### Exclusive, diffractive and tagging phyiscs

* How can we develop a benchmark for an analysis code to pass on to the validation software team?

##### Semi-inclusive physics

* What is included in the campaign, and what are the major changes compared to before?
* How can we access various (SI)DIS variables through different reconstruction methods?
* How do we match tracks and clusters from the calorimeters?
* How can we access hadron and electron PID data?
* How do we navigate from reconstructed to truth information?


##### Jets and Heavy Flavor physics

* Is there an organized repository or wiki that guides newcomers to the right tutorials and slides?
* Are there quick starter-code examples (Analyzer macros) for accessing branch information and creating physics plots?

##### Beyond the Standard Model and precision electroweak phyiscs

* Can you provide an example of analyzing EICrecon data using basic methods?
